Request to Response Explanation

When a client sends an HTTP request, it is sent to the server using a specific URL and method.
The request may include headers and a body depending on the request type.
The server processes the request and performs the required action.
After processing, the server sends a response back to the client.
The response contains a status code, headers, and data.
The client receives the response and displays or uses the data.
This complete process is known as the request–response lifecycle.
